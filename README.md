### :gem:Hi, I’m Miguel Ricaño:gem:

# Welcome to my Crib

I’m a senior software engineer with experience building and maintaining full stack systems, from user-facing applications to backend services, APIs, and internal platforms.

My work usually sits at the intersection of product, infrastructure, and integrations: designing systems that are reliable, secure, and easy for other teams and partners to build on.

### What I work on
- Full stack development across frontend and backend systems
- Designing and maintaining APIs (GraphQL and REST)
- Internal tools, admin platforms, and operational workflows
- Security, validation, and data consistency in production systems
- AI and LLM integrations used in real-world products
- Performance, scalability, and technical debt reduction

### Tech I use often
Ruby on Rails, Node.js, TypeScript, React, PostgreSQL, GraphQL, REST APIs, background jobs, LLM integrations

If you’re building complex products or platforms and want to collaborate, feel free to reach out.
